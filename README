Menu paths and access callbacks to embed research_views
This tiny module was created to avoid using default views arguments
to specify the researcher uid (ie to secure view) and to hide the menu entry
for non researchers

Dependent on 'repo_researcher' feature as uses view defined 'therein'


It could easily be extended to allow for more complex access control.
